# Facies classification
The dataset comes from a course from The University of Kansas. The objective is to predict facies from well log data. This project is focused on supervised learning. Wireline data (GR, ILD, PHI, Neutron, PE) has been coupled with core descriptions. In addition, each datapoint includes two geological constraining variables: nonmarine-marine indicator, and relative position. Combining these two data, participants are requested to propose and apply one or multiple solutions to this classification problem. Some popular methods are: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and/or support vector machines. These are initial suggestions, and participants are encouraged to try different supervised methods and compare results. ​
Level-up: The dataset is relatively "imbalanced". What does this imply? How can this be addressed?​
