# Well log based reservoir property estimation
The objective of this contest is to develop data-driven models to estimate reservoir properties, including shale volume, porosity, and fluid saturation (Other properties can be considered), based on a common set of well logs. The mini-project is an example of supervised learning, specifically, it is a case of regression.  

**Case study:** VOLVE field

**Suggested methods:** Supervised learning,  Regression. Non-parametric regression / Neural Networks / Random forest. ​
