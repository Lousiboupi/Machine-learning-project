# Production data forecast using data-driven approaches 

The relationship between petrophysical parameters, production conditions and hydrocarbon volumes is non-linear. It can be challenging to propose a relationship between them with conventional mathematical approaches. Therefore, data-driven approaches, such as Machine Learning, can capture the relationship between these parameters, and propose predictions of produced volumes. ​

This mini-project focus on developing predictions using production data from a single well in the Volve field. The independent variables for this problem include downhole pressure, temperature and fluid production volumes. Participants are encouraged to apply diverse supervised ML techniques to forecast the hydrocarbon production of a well in the Volve field. ​
