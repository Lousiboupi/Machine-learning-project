# Lithofacies prediction from well logs 

From wells located in both the south and north of the Viking graben, apply supervised learning to predict lithofacies from well logs. Participants will be provided with well logs such as caliper, resistivity, gamma ray, density, porosity, sonic, and others . Each observation will have an associated lithology class label and confidence. The objective is to predict lithofacies of blind wells using machine learning approaches. The data includes 22 train wells and 3 blind wells.
